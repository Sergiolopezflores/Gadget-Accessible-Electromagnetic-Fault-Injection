This folder contains the files necessary to train and validate the AI models.

The CSV files of the different captures we have made have already been created, put together in a csv_final.txt file and converted to one-hot-encoding format in the one-hot-encoding.txt file which is the one we need to train and validate the different ML and DL models.

The creation of these files is detailed in the scripts folder.
